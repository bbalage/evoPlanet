# :full_moon: evoPlanet

The evoPlanet project's GitHub Pages is available [here](https://bbalage.github.io/evoPlanet/).

The project is about creating a **web based orbital simulator**, where users can create arbitrary systems of stellar objects, and can make them move according to the Newtonian rules of gravity.

The created stellar setups can be shared online with other users, and they can also simulate the gravity systems.
